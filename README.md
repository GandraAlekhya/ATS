An attendance Tracking system is how a organization keeps track of the time and attendance information of students. A good attendance tracking system saves you time and effort.  It cuts down on paperwork and saves time so that accurate attendance reports can be made. It is safe because each user has their own login ID and password. This system lets the instructor take attendance and generate an attendance report. The instructor can also see number of students who are in class.

An attendance tracking system will allow teachers to reduce the amount of time they spend manually documenting attendance. The major goal is to automate student attendance by scanning a QR code and updating attendance in the course, as well as informing the Instructor of attendance report.

An attendance tracking System is an  iOS application that enables users to update their attendance by scanning the QR code generated by the instructor with their camera and being linked to the website, where they can check up information about the courses and their attendance reports. The teacher, on the other hand, can generate a QR code for a particular course and look at student information such as attendance arrival time, student count, and an overall class report. The data will be updated automatically from the backend, i.e. Firebase. In this application, the instructor may save a lot of back-end work like manually updating data, and avoid corrections that are done manually, and record an accurate attendance by scanning the QR code, which also helps to record the late attendance if they are later to class by recording the time.
